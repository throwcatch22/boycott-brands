Brands that support genocide, murder and mass destitution are named and shamed here

### How to contribute

#### Via github
Once you create a new branch from main, with the brand name being the name of the brand, there will be three things to do.
- Append the name of the brand into `the-list.md` file, some rules for adding the brand name are as follows
   - Add a comma when adding a new brand entry, e.g `example,example2,new example`. With no space between the commas
   - The name of the folder and files should all have consistent casing with what is in `the-list.txt`
   - If the name consists of two or more words, the expected format should have normal spacing between them (no double spacing)
   - Ignore any apostrophes in the word, e.g instead of `Denny's` you would include it as `Dennys`, and words that include accents like `Caf√©` would be removed and be `Cafe`
- Create a new folder, residing in the `brands` directory
   - The name of the folder and files should all have consistent casing with what is in `the-list.txt`
   - Ignore apostrophes and accents as above
   - Should contain dashes where the space should be in the brand name, e.g `mr write` should be `mr-write`
- Once created, inside this folder, you should upload two files, with the example name and convention the same as the folder it lives in. E.g `example/example.md` , `dr-pepper/dr-pepper.png`
   - A .png file of the brand logo (should ideally be less than 20kb and around 240 X 240 pixels in size - if you need help with that one of us can provide it üëç)
   - A .md file, which contains the evidence that this brand partakes in aiding evil/wrongdoing.

Thank you for contributing, it means alot to be able to add or even think of adding a brand. We can one day, through this or any other means, have the power again to stop evil in this world. Believe!
